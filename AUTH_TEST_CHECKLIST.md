3. Check if Supabase project has email auth enabled

### If user profile errors:
1. Check if SQL schema was run in Supabase
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled
3. Check network tab for 404/403 errors

### If rate limiting doesn't update:

## Console Commands for Debugging:

Open browser console and run:

// Check if Supabase is connected
localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token')

// Check current usage
localStorage.getItem('apiUsage')

// Check rate limiter
window.rateLimiter?.getUsageStats()
```
